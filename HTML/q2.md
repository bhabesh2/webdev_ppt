Q.2 Explain Semantic tags in html? And why do we need it?

Ans: Semantic tags in HTML are elements that carry meaning and define the structure of the content within a web page. Unlike non-semantic tags like <div> or <span>, which are used purely for styling purposes, semantic tags provide contextual information about the content they enclose.

Need of semantic tags:

1. They enhance the accessibility of web pages.
2. Semantic tags improve the overall SEO of a website. Search engines rely on structured data to understand the content and relevance of web pages.
3. semantic tags make the code more readable and maintainable. By using appropriate tags, developers can easily identify and modify specific sections of a webpage.
