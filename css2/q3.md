Q.3 Explain the concept of Breakpoints in Responsive Web Design and How They are used in Media Queries.

Ans: Essentially, media query breakpoints are pixel values that a developer/designer can define in CSS. When a responsive website reaches those pixel values, a transformation (such as the one detailed above) occurs so that the website offers an optimal user experience.

for small screens

@media screen and (max-width: 576px) {
  /* CSS rules for screens with width 600px or less */
  /* Responsive styles for small screens */
}

for medium screens

@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
  /* CSS rules for screens with width 600px or less */
  /* Responsive styles for small screens */
}

for large screens

@media screen and (max-width: 992px) {
  /* CSS rules for screens with width 600px or less */
  /* Responsive styles for small screens */
}

there are lots of different screen sizes and we as a developer can't go for all of them so developer maintain a standard common screen sizes for mobile tablet and laptop or bigger screen.
