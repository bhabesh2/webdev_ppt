Q.8 Difference between absolute and relative and sticky and fixed position explain with example.

Ans:

Absolute position: Positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor. It is removed from the normal flow of the document and scrolls with its nearest ancestor.

Relative position: Positioned relative to its normal position, and it retains its space in the normal flow. It scrolls with its normal position.

Sticky position: Initially behaves like relative, but then becomes fixed at a specific position during scrolling. It sticks to a specific position in the viewport when scrolled.

Fixed position: Positioned relative to the viewport, and it is removed from the normal flow of the document. It remains fixed at a specific position in the viewport and does not scroll with the content.
