Q.9 Explain Class in JavaScript? 


In JavaScript, a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects with similar properties and behaviors. It is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows developers to define and create objects based on a predefined structure. 

class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  sayHello() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
  }
}

// Create an instance of the Person class
const person1 = new Person("Bhabesh Bharali", 27);
person1.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, my name is Bhabesh Bharali and I am 27 years old.
