Q.3 Differentiate between HTML Tags and Elements?

Ans: HTML tags are the building blocks of an HTML document. They are surrounded by angle brackets (< and >) and are used to mark up specific parts of the content. 

For example, the <p> tag is used to define a paragraph, the <h1> to <h6> tags represent headings of different levels, and the <img> tag is used to insert an image into the webpage etc.

Element:----->

HTML elements are created by enclosing content within HTML tags. An HTML element consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. The opening tag marks the beginning of the element, while the closing tag marks its end.

like <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

so besically 

<p></p> ----> tag
<p>This is a paragraph.</p> now tag become element with some content.
