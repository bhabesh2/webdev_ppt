 Q.6 Whatâ€™s z-index and How does it Function ?

 Ans: Z-index controls the stacking order of elements. Higher values appear above lower ones. 

 Higher z-index (Front)
    -------------
    |     3     |
    -------------
    |     2     |
    -------------
    |     1     |
    -------------
Lower z-index (Back)

element 3 has the highest z-index and is positioned in front of elements 1 and 2. Element 2 has a z-index lower than element 3 but higher than element 1, so it appears between them. Element 1 has the lowest z-index and is positioned at the back.
