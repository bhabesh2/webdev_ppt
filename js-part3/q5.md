Q.5 Whats Abstraction and Its Purpose?

Ans: Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that involves representing complex systems or entities with simplified models. It focuses on identifying and defining essential features and behaviors while hiding unnecessary details. 

Simplification: Abstraction simplifies the understanding and implementation of complex systems by breaking them down into manageable and understandable parts.

Data Hiding: Abstraction involves hiding internal implementation details and providing only the necessary information and functionality to interact with an object. 

Modularity: Abstraction promotes modularity by organizing code into separate modules or classes, each responsible for a specific set of functionalities.

Code Flexibility: Abstraction allows for flexibility in code design and implementation. 

Simplified Communication: Abstraction provides a common language or interface to communicate and interact with objects. 

In summary, abstraction simplifies complex systems by focusing on essential aspects while hiding unnecessary details.
