Q.1 Whatâ€™s difference between Synchronous and Asynchronous?

```

timing --> Synchronous--> Requires all parties to be present or respond in real-time.
Interaction-->Synchronous-->Communication happens in a sequential manner.
waiting--> Synchronous--> Participants need to wait for each other's responses before proceeding.
Examples--> Synchronous-->Phone calls, live video chats, instant messaging.

timing-->Asynchronous-->Parties can participate at their own pace without real-time constraints.
Interaction-->Asynchronous-->Participants can interact independently of each other.
waiting-->Asynchronous-->Participants can continue with other tasks while waiting for responses.
Examples-->Asynchronous-->Email, forums, text messages, asynchronous online discussions.
