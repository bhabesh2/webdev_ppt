Q.3 What is VW/VH ?

Ans: In CSS, "vw" stands for viewport width. It is a unit of measurement that represents a percentage of the width of the viewport. The viewport refers to the visible portion of a web page within the browser window.

The value of 1vw is equal to 1% of the width of the viewport. For example, if the viewport width is 1000 pixels, then 1vw is equal to 10 pixels.

p {
  font-size: 5vw;
}


In CSS, "vh" stands for viewport height. It is a unit of measurement that represents a percentage of the height of the viewport. The viewport refers to the visible portion of a web page within the browser window.

Similar to "vw" (viewport width), the value of 1vh is equal to 1% of the height of the viewport. For example, if the viewport height is 800 pixels, then 1vh is equal to 8 pixels.

div {
  height: 50vh;
}
