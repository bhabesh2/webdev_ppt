Q.8 Whats Encapsulation and Purpose of it ?


Encapsulation: Bundles data (attributes/properties) and methods (behaviors/functions) together within a class.

Data Hiding: Encapsulation hides the internal implementation details of an object and provides controlled access to its data through methods.

Access Modifiers: Access modifiers (e.g., public, private, protected) define the level of access to the data and methods within a class.

Data Integrity: Encapsulation ensures data integrity by preventing unauthorized access or modification of the object's data.

Abstraction: Encapsulation facilitates abstraction by exposing only relevant methods and hiding unnecessary implementation details.
