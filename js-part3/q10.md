Q.10 Whatâ€™s Super Keyword & What it does?


In JavaScript, the super keyword is used to call and access the parent class's properties and methods from within a subclass. It is typically used in the constructor and methods of a subclass to refer to the parent class's constructor and methods.

class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  eat() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is eating.`);
  }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    super(name); // Call the parent class's constructor to initialize the 'name' property
    this.breed = breed;
  }

  meow() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is a ${this.breed} cat.`);
  }

  eat() {
    super.eat(); // Call the parent class's 'eat' method
    console.log(`${this.name} is eating cat food.`);
  }
}

const cat1 = new Cat("Whiskers", "Siamese");
cat1.meow(); // Output: Whiskers is a Siamese cat.
cat1.eat();
// Output:
// Whiskers is eating.
// Whiskers is eating cat food.
