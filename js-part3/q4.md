Q.4 Explain OOPS ? 

Ans: OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects, which are instances of classes. It emphasizes the concepts of encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Here's a brief explanation of these OOPS principles


Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (attributes or properties) and methods (functions or behaviors) together within a class. It allows for the data to be accessed and manipulated only through the defined methods, providing control over the data's integrity and security

Inheritance: Inheritance allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects or classes.

Polymorphism: Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects to take on multiple forms or have multiple behaviors. 

Abstraction: Abstraction focuses on representing essential features and behavior of objects, while hiding unnecessary implementation details. 

Object-oriented programming promotes modular and reusable code, improves code organization and maintainability, and enables a more intuitive representation of real-world entities and relationships
