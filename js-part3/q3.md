Q.3 Whatâ€™s Call Apply Bind Method & Difference Between them

The call, apply, and bind are three methods in JavaScript that allow you to control the context (this value) and arguments of a function. Here's an explanation of each method and the differences between them:

call: The call method is used to invoke a function with a specified this value and individual arguments provided as separate arguments.

function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}! My name is ${this.name}.`);
}

const person = { name: "John" };

greet.call(person, "Alice"); // Output: Hello, Alice! My name is John.


apply: The apply method is similar to call, but it accepts arguments as an array-like object. The syntax for apply is functionName.apply(thisValue, [arg1, arg2, ...]).

function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

const numbers = [3, 5];

const result = sum.apply(null, numbers); // Output: 8


bind: The bind method creates a new function with a specified this value and any number of arguments. Unlike call and apply, bind does not immediately invoke the function but returns a new function with the bound this value. The syntax for bind is 

function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

const double = multiply.bind(null, 2);

const result = double(4); // Output: 8


In summary, call and apply are used for immediate function invocation, while bind is used to create a new function with a bound this value and pre-set arguments.
