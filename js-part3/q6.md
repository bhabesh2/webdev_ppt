Q.6 Whats Polymorphism and Purpose of it?

Polymorphism: Allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common superclass or interface.

Here are a few key aspects of polymorphism:

Method Overriding: Subclasses provide their own implementation for methods already defined in their superclass.

Code Reusability: Objects of different classes can be treated uniformly using a common interface or superclass. Common functionality can be defined in a superclass and utilized by multiple subclasses.

Runtime Binding: The specific implementation of a method is determined at runtime based on the actual object type rather than the reference type.

Interface Implementation: Polymorphism is often achieved through the implementation of interfaces, which define a set of method signatures that participating classes must implement.
