Q.2 Explain Web Apis

Ans: A Web API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other over the internet.

Endpoint: A Web API exposes one or more endpoints or URLs that represent specific resources or actions. Developers can make HTTP requests to these endpoints to retrieve or manipulate data.

Request Methods: Web APIs support different HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., which correspond to different operations like retrieving data, creating new resources, updating existing resources, or deleting resources.

Data Format: APIs typically use common data formats like JSON or XML to structure and exchange data. JSON has become the de facto standard due to its simplicity and compatibility with JavaScript.

Authentication and Authorization: APIs often require authentication to ensure secure access to protected resources. Developers may need to obtain an API key, token, or implement more advanced authentication mechanisms like OAuth.

Rate Limiting: To prevent abuse and ensure fair usage, APIs may implement rate limiting, which restricts the number of requests a client can make within a specified time period.

Error Handling: Web APIs provide error handling mechanisms to communicate various types of errors to the client, such as invalid requests, authentication failures, or server errors.
