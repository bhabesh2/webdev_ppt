Q.8 Explain Purpose of Try and Catch block

```
The purpose of the try block is to enclose the code that might potentially throw an error or exception. Inside the try block, you write the code that you want to monitor for errors. If an error occurs within the try block, the normal flow of execution is immediately interrupted, and the control is transferred to the corresponding catch block.

The purpose of the catch block is to define how to handle the error or exception that occurred within the try block.
```
````
function divideNumbers(a, b) {
  try {
    if (b === 0) {
      throw new Error('Division by zero');
    }
    const result = a / b;
    console.log('Result:', result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}

divideNumbers(10, 2); // Result: 5
divideNumbers(10, 0); // Error: Division by zero
```
