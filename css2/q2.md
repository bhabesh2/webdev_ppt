Q.2 How do you define a media query in CSS?

Ans: In CSS, a media query is a technique used to apply different styles to a web page based on certain device characteristics or conditions, such as screen size, resolution, orientation, or device capabilities. 

Here's an example of a media query that applies styles when the viewport width is 600 pixels or less:

@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  /* CSS rules for screens with width 600px or less */
  /* Responsive styles for small screens */
}
